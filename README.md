# sun-display
The software for running the RVCC Planetarium sun display (historical and modern).

## Keyboard Controls
Keys 1-4 will switch between wavelengths, left arrow key will go backwards in images, right arrow key will go forwards in images.

## AIA
AIA stands for Atmospheric Imaging Assembly which is "four-telescope array, operating primarily in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV), aboard NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory." Read more about it [here.](https://aia.cfa.harvard.edu/) The numbers after aia refer to the wavelength of the image in angstroms.

## AIA Panel - Sun Image Connection

# AIA 193 
Shows outer atmosphere of sun + Shows hot flare plasma. |<mark>2.6 million F|

# AIA 171 
Shows where there is a strong magnetic field near the surface + Shows coronal loops. |<mark>1.8 million F|

# AIA 304 
Shows areas that have cooler dense plumes of plasma + Bright areas show high plasma density. |<mark>90,000 F|

# AIA 211 
Shows active region of outer atmosphere the corona + Coronal Mass Ejections and solar flares appear bright here + It also shows Coronal Holes as dark holes which is the main source of solar wind. |<mark>3.6 million F|
